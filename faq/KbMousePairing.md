# The Keyboard and/or Mouse does not work.

Depending on which one is not responding, try re-pair it with the wireless dongle as follow:  

#### Pairing the Keyboard
1. Unplug the wireless dongle.  
2. Switch off the keyboard and the mouse.  
3. Plug the wireless dongle back into the CrowPi2, switch on the keyboard and you should see the **Status** light come on. When this happens, immediately press and hold down both the **Esc** and the **Q** keys until the **Status** light (blue light) starts blinking.  
4. Keep the keyboard close to the wireless dongle.
5. Once the **Status** light stop blinking and on, it means you have successfully paired the keyboard.  
6. If the **Status** light is still blinking, just unplug the wireless dongle and then plug it back into the USB port to see the result of step 5.  

#### Pairing the Mouse
1. Unplug the wireless dongle.  
2. Switch off the keyboard and the mouse.  
3. Switch on the mouse and quickly plug the wireless dongle back into the CrowPi2.  
4. Move the mouse around on a flat surface until the mouse pointer on the display moves.  
5. When this happens, it means you have succeeded pairing the mouse.
