### Scratch 1.4

2. At the command prompt, type `nano ~/.scratch.ini` and press **Enter**.  
3. Add the line, `fontscale=1.3` (Try experiment with different values as desired).  
4. Press **Ctrl**+**X**, **Y** to save the changes and exit the nano text editor.  


### Scratch 2.0  

1. In the **Scratch Desktop**, hold-down **Shift** and click on the **Globe** icon.
